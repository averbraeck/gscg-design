## 4.1.1. High-level database design

The GSCG database is designed in three separate 'compartments' that are related, but managed by different roles:

1. **GSCG Admin data** with the organizations and users and their access rights.
2. **Game Design data** with the defined game instances with their actors, parameters, scenarios and player strategies.
3. **Game State data** with game sessions, game state, and game results

The results from the game can also be sent to the external data platform [gamedata.nl](https://gamedata.nl). In a sense, this defines a fourth data set:

4. **Game Play data** with game sessions, game state, and game results


## 4.1.2. GSCG Admin data

The GSCG Admin data supports the roles, use cases and requirements for the Portal Administrator, Organization Administrator, and Session Administrator. Important tasks are user administration, game administration, organization administration, and session administration. This leads to the following envisioned tables in the database:

- `organization` with the data for an organization that can define and play games.
- `user` with the data of someone who can log into one of the apps for GSCG. Note that a `player` is not necessarily a `user`, since they can be anonymous. A user can have a special characteristic `portal_admin` for portal administrators, who can create and delete instances of `organization` and a `game`, and can allocate the `game_role` for the game designer and `organization_role` for the organization administrator. Also the portal_admin is the only user who can make a `game` available to an `organization`.
- `organization_role` with the roles that a `user` can fulfill for the `organization`. One of the roles is to be the organization administrator, who can allocate roles to oher users for the organization.
- `game` as a placeholder for the definition of a game. `game` is related to the tables where the game designer role (a `user` with a `game_role`) can define and update one or more instances of `game_version`.
- `game_version` as a version of the game. Multiple versions with differences can exist. Game versions are not by definition tied to a specific `organization`, allowing games to be played by multiple organizations.
- `game_role` connecting a game designer (a `user`) to a `game`.
- `organization_game` defining that a particular `organization` has access to a `game`, so the `organization` can instantiate a `game_session`.
- `game_session` is a frozen instance of a `game_version` that can be played on certain dates. It has allocated `players` and one or more game facilitators. A facilitator is a `user` with a certain role for that `game_session`.
- `game_session_role` defines the instances of `user` who can act as game facilitators, or session administrators.
- `player` contains the properties of self-generated game players, or game players generated by the game facilitator or session administrator. Since players can be anonymous, a `player` is not necessarily a persistent `user` in the database, but it can be.

The design of the GSCG Admin data tables looks as follows:

![](diagrams/gscg-database-admin.png)


## 4.1.3. Game design data

Game design data contains all data necessary to create and start a game. The database from the previous GSCG project was extremely complicated, with multiple layers defining software templates for actor definitions and their parameters on one layer, and the game definition and parameter values on another layer. This made the database complex, and instantiation slow. The database and the code to be executed do have a relation, of course. A database record (or set of records) defining an actor should contain the relevant properties for that actor as it is defined in the code. In that sense, the database 'mirrors' the simulation objects that have to be instantiated. The old database design was as follows:

![](diagrams/gscg_database_20070305.png)

Defining a game was a multi-month project due to the complexity of the database. In the design for this project, it might therefore be good to take a more lean approach, while keeping flexibility and maintainability. The tables for the game will be described in a number of steps below.

The overall diagram (with a couple or relations left out) is still complicated. Blue types refer to the Admin tables. Green tables define a game without values for the parameters. These tables set-up a rough scaffold for the game. Red tables define the details for the game, such as locations, distances, and values for the parameters of the actors, handlers, and autonomous processes.

![](diagrams/gscg-database-game-design.png)

Let's break down the database into several sub-components:

### Product tables

The product tables define the product, sku, and bill-of-materials:

- `product` gives the main characteristics of a product in the game or simulation. It specifies the name, the sock keping unit (`sku`), the average volume and weight (with units), the depreciation as a fraction per day, and a (starting / average) unit market price per `sku`.
- `sku` defines the way that the product is typically transported, such as on a pallet, in a 20 ft or 40 ft container, in a box, as a unit, etc. Each of the sku types has a maximum volume and weight, defining how many `product` instances fit in one `sku`.
- `bill_of_materials` defines the assembly of a `product` from semi-finished products or raw materials. The `bill_of_materials` uniquely belongs to a product and has multiple instances of a `bom_item`. Note that the `bill_of_materials` for a `product` van be `null`.
- `bom_item` is one product that is needed to assemble into another product, with the `amount` of `product` that is needed as one of its attributes.

The partial relations look as follows:

![](diagrams/gscg-database-product.png)


### Actor and Role tables

The actor table defines the organizations (agents) in the game with their location, whereas the role specifies the processing per type of decision that has to be made. The tables and relations look as follows:

- `actor_type` is a reference to an exisiting Java implementation of a type of actor in the simulation library. Therefore, it contains a reference to a `java_type`. The `actor_type` is defined on the game-level, since different instances of `game_version` can have a different set of defined actors.
- `actor` is the instantiation of an `actor_type` in the `game_version`. It has a `location` and one or more instances of `role`.
- `role_type` defines a role for an `actor_type` such as Purchasing, Selling, Producing, Banking or Transporting in the simulation library. Therefore, it contains a reference to a `java_type`.
- `role` is the instantiation of an `role_type` in the `game_version`. The `role` has a `content_receiver` that specifies when content (messages) can be received and how long it takes to process.
- `content_receiver` is a specification of the delay that occurs when receiving content (messages). It handles fixed delays, stochastic delays and working times of the actor (See Issue #18).
- `location` specifies an (x,y) or (lon,lat) position for the `actor`. It is located on a `landmass`. A location also has a timezone offset for global trade, see Issue #36.
- `landmass` is important, since trucks and trains cannot transport goods between landmasses, only on landmasses. For quick calculations on a landmass, the average truck speed is given for the landmass.

The partial relations look as follows:

![](diagrams/gscg-database-actor-role.png)


### Actor and Role parameter/value tables

The actors and roles have parameters that need to be defined in the database. Every parameter has a type and a value for the game instance. The `actor_type`, `actor`, `role_type` and `role` have already been defined above. The tables and relations look as follows:

- `parameter_type` defines the java types that can be used, such as `int`, `double`, `DistContinuous`, `DistDiscrete`, `Speed`, `Length`, etc. Note that the definition is 'blue', which means that it is defined outside of the `game` or `game_version`. 
- `actor_parameter` belongs to an `actor_type` and indicates which parameters can or should be defined for an `actor` instance.
- `actor_value` provides the value of an `actor_parameter` for an `actor` instance.
- `role_parameter` belongs to a `role_type` and indicates which parameters can or should be defined for a `role` instance.
- `role_value` provides the value of a `role_parameter` for a `role` instance.


The partial relations look as follows:

![](diagrams/gscg-database-parameters.png)


### Handler and Process tables

The `handler` is the rule class for an actor that takes care of handling a certain `content_type`, such as an `Order`, a `RequestForQuote`, a `Payment` or a `Shipment`. A `process` is the definition of an autonomous process. The autonomous process in the simulation is not triggered by the receipt of a content message, such as the handler, but it acts autonomously, often based on a gien frequency. An example is a marker that buys products on a regular basis, or a Make-to-Stock producer of goods that makes its goods available to the market, irrespective of demand. The tables `role_type` and `role` have already been defined above.

- `parameter_type` defines the java types that can be used, such as `int`, `double`, `DistContinuous`, `DistDiscrete`, `Speed`, `Length`, etc. Note that the definition is 'blue', which means that it is defined outside of the `game` or `game_version`. 
- `handler_type` links to the definition of the handler in Java through the `java_type` field. It is linked to the `role_type` hat is defined on the level of a `game`.
- `handler` is a specific instantiation of the `handler_type` for a `role`, which is defined on the level of a `game_version`. 
- `content_type` is the type of message that the `handler` can handle in the simulation. Note that the definition is 'blue', which means that it is defined outside of the `game` or `game_version`. 
- `handler_parameter` belongs to a `handler_type` and indicates which parameters can or should be defined for a `handler` instance.
- `handler_value` provides the value of a `handler_parameter` for a `handler` instance.
- `process_type` links to the definition of the autonomous process in Java through the `java_type` field. It is linked to the `role_type` hat is defined on the level of a `game`.
- `process` is a specific instantiation of the `process_type` for a `role`, which is defined on the level of a `game_version`. 
- `process_parameter` belongs to a `process_type` and indicates which parameters can or should be defined for a `process` instance.
- `process_value` provides the value of a `process_parameter` for a `process` instance.

The partial relations look as follows:

![](diagrams/gscg-database-handler-process.png)

Additionally, handlers can be restricted from which actors they process messages (e.g., take an order), and for which products they process messages (e.g., take an order):

![](diagrams/gscg-database-handler-valid.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The `handler_valid_actor` now works on the `actor` instance level. Maybe the restriction should be defined on the `actor_type` level. As an example, a personal customer can typically not buy products from a factory. Factory is an `actor_type` with many instances. Maybe two restrictions can be added: one for `actor`, and one for `actor_type`.


### Transport tables

Transport modes and distances are provided in the transport tables. The `location` and `landmass` have already been defined above.

- `transport_mode` defines a transport mode, such as `Truck`, `Rail`, `Air` or `Ship`. Variants of these transport modes with different characteristics can of course also be defined.
- `handled_sku` indicates which type of packaging for products are handled by the `transport_mode`. A ship dies not take aircraft pallets, and an airplane cannot transport a 40 ft ISO container. The table links `sku` to `transport_mode` for the valid sku's that can be transported.
- `transfer` defines a link in the transport network. It indicates you can transport goods (products) from `location` A to `location` B with a certain `transport_mode`. An indication of the distance and travel time is provided as well. 

![](diagrams/gscg-database-transport.png)

> [!TIP]
> Typically, the supply chain model will be set-up as a hub-and-spoke network. Actors are connected to the nearest hub per transport mode, such as ports, airports and rail terminals. Trucking on a landmass can be estimated using the `truck_speed` attribute in the `landmass` definition using a rough estimate of the distance between the two locations on the landmass.


### Scenario tables

In the game, events and news messages can be inserted at pre-defined times, random times, or facilitator-triggered times. Events can relate to actors, roles, handlers, autonomous processes, transport links, or any other variable in the simulation or game. Therefore, no explicit links to tables in the database are made for now, since the events can relate to many of the tables in the database. `game_version`, `actor_type` and `actor` have already been defined before.

- `game_scenario` defines a scenario for a `game_version`. Note that a `game_version` can have multiple instances of a `game_scenario`. The facilitator can activate one scenario at a time for game play. In a `game_scenario`, events and news messages can be defined.
- `event` is a table that can activate or deactivate a game object, such as an actor or a transport mode. To identify the object, the type is given as well as the database id or the object name. The event can be triggered at a time, time interval, or based on facilitator input. An `event` *can* have an associated `news_message` that will be fired exactly when the event is triggered.
- `trigger_fixed` is a trigger at a fixed point in time. When the game clock is a `datetime`, this can be specified. When the gametime is a `double` or a `Duration`, this can be specified as well, including the unit. When `facilitator_trigger` equals 1, the facilitator can trigger the event as well. When all timestamp fields are `null`, and `facilitator_trigger` equals 1, the event can *only* be triggered by the facilitator. 
- `trigger_interval` is a trigger that will be fired on a uniform interval between two timestamps. The timestamps can either be expressed as a a `datetime`, or as a `double` or a `Duration`, including the unit. The `trigger_interval` can also be triggered by the facilitator, analogous to the `trigger_fixed`. 
- `news_message` is a communication to the players. A `news_message` can either be triggered at a fixed time, or it is associated with an `event`. The players to whom the `news_message` will be sent can be restricted by the `news_actor` and `news_actor_type` tables. When both are blank, the `news_message` is sent to all players.
- `news_actor` specifies to which actor instances a `news_message` is sent.
- `news_actor_type` specifies to which actor types a `news_message` is sent.

## 4.1.4. Game state data

Several solutions exist for the storage of game state data:

1. Storing all *transactions*. The advantage of this approach is that it is very easy. Transactions are triggered by the messages (content) sent between supply chain actors. Additional transactions are player input and facilitator input. Given known seeds of the random number generators, the game is fully reproducible with this information. Theoretically, storing the messages is not even necessary, since they are either triggered by a previous message, or by (predictable) agent behavior or by player or facilitator input. The disadvantage is that for restoring the state of the game, the entire game has to be replayed from t=0.
2. Saving the *entire state* of the game regularly, e.g., once per play day or week. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for a quick restore. The disadvantage is that tracing the progress of the game for analysis purposes is much harder, although that is actually the task of the Game Play data for analytics. Another disadvantage is that the latest player decisions are lost.
3. *Combining* a regular state save with the transactions since the last state save. The advantage is that it is complete and can do a quick full restore. The disadvantage is that two mechanisms have to be implemented.

The data tables for game state data will be defined after a choice has been made. This asks for a bit deeper analysis of the software setup.

> [!NOTE]
> A choice has to be made for the persistence layer of the GSCG platform.



## 4.1.5 Game play data for analysis

The game play data that is sent to the data analysis platform (scores, play information for analysis) does not need any extra information in the database. The database for game analytics has already been set-up and mirrors the Admin data for GSCG as defined above: see [gamedata documentation](https://github.com/averbraeck/gamedata-common/blob/main/docs) for more info. The database is defined as follows:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/averbraeck/gamedata-common/main/docs/20241231_Gamedata.png)

The structure with tables for `organization`, `user`, `game`, `game_version`, `game_session` and `player` plus linking tables to define the access of different users is very similar to the set-up of the Admin data for GSCG.

No additional data has to be stored for game play right now, in case the game play information is sent to the gamedata platform. In case we want to store this information locally in the GSCG database, several of the tables from the gamedata database can be copied into the GSCG database.

  <br>The `user` table is in the database.
- FC4.4 The session administrator must be able to reset the password of a user
  <br>The `user.password` field is in the database.
- FC4.5 The session administrator must be able to change the access rights of a user
  <br>The `game_session_role` tables in the database define the access rights of a user.
- FC4.6 The session administrator must be able to create a game session
  <br>This is not logical from the database right now. See NOTE.
- FC4.7 The session administrator must be able to change the dates of a game session
  <br>A `game_session` has fields `play_date`, `valid_from` and `valid_until` (all `DATETIME` fields).

  <br>No consequences for database.
- FC4.16 The session administrator must be able to set or change the allowable strategies that can be chosen by the players

The non-functional requirements have no effect on the database.

> [!NOTE]
> **FC4.6**: It is not logical for a session admin to be able to create a session in the database, since the session admin is allocated to individual sessions through the `game_session_role` table. Non-existent game sessions are not linked and can therefore not be created. This has to be solved, probably in the `organization_role` table, or in a new table `organization_game_role`.

> [!NOTE]
> **FC4.10**: A field `self_registration` should be added to the `game_session`.

> [!NOTE]
> **FO4.12**: Maybe a table `organization_game_role` should be added to allow to appoint session administrators for a certain `game` from an `organization`.

> [!NOTE]
> **FO4.13**: The fields `edit` and `view` for the `same_session_role` are not descriptive enough to indicate who is a facilitator for a session. Maybe change the fields to `facilitator` and `observer`?


### 4.1.6.5. Session facilitation
