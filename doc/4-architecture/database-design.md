## High-level database design

The GSCG database is designed in three separate 'compartments' that are related, but managed by different roles:

1. **GSCG Admin data** with the organizations and users and their access rights.
2. **Game Design data** with the defined game instances with their actors, parameters, scenarios and player strategies.
3. **Game State data** with game sessions, game state, and game results

The results from the game can also be sent to the external data platform [gamedata.nl](https://gamedata.nl). In a sense, this defines a fourth data set:

4. **Game Play data** with game sessions, game state, and game results


## GSCG Admin data

The GSCG Admin data supports the roles, use cases and requirements for the Portal Administrator, Organization Administrator, and Session Administrator. Important tasks are user administration, game administration, organization administration, and session administration. This leads to the following envisioned tables in the database:

- `organization` with the data for an organization that can define and play games.
- `user` with the data of someone who can log into one of the apps for GSCG. Note that a `player` is not necessarily a `user`, since they can be anonymous. A user can have a special characteristic `portal_admin` for portal administrators, who can create and delete instances of `organization` and a `game`, and can allocate the `game_role` for the game designer and `organization_role` for the organization administrator. Also the portal_admin is the only user who can make a `game` available to an `organization`.
- `organization_role` with the roles that a `user` can fulfill for the `organization`. One of the roles is to be the organization administrator, who can allocate roles to oher users for the organization.
- `game` as a placeholder for the definition of a game. `game` is related to the tables where the game designer role (a `user` with a `game_role`) can define and update one or more instances of `game_version`.
- `game_version` as a version of the game. Multiple versions with differences can exist. Game versions are not by definition tied to a specific `organization`, allowing games to be played by multiple organizations.
- `game_role` connecting a game designer (a `user`) to a `game`.
- `organization_game` defining that a particular `organization` has access to a `game`, so the `organization` can instantiate a `game_session`.
- `game_session` is a frozen instance of a `game_version` that can be played on certain dates. It has allocated `players` and one or more game facilitators. A facilitator is a `user` with a certain role for that `game_session`.
- `game_session_role` defines the instances of `user` who can act as game facilitators, or session administrators.
- `player` contains the properties of self-generated game players, or game players generated by the game facilitator or session administrator. Since players can be anonymous, a `player` is not necessarily a persistent `user` in the database, but it can be.

The design of the GSCG Admin data tables looks as follows:
