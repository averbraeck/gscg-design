# Plan for development

## Standards for systems and software engineering

## Plan

```
1. Define Scope & Stakeholders
2. Capture Use Cases & Operational Scenarios
3. Define System Requirements
   └── Functional, Non-functional, Constraints
4. Architect the System
   └── Component Breakdown, Interfaces, Deployment
5. Design Simulation Components
   ├── Function & Service Design (by use case)
   ├── Class/Object Model (if needed)
   └── Data Model (entities, interactions, timing)
6. Plan & Define Integration Architecture
   └── Time management, federation interfaces, live component links
7. Develop Components & Services
   └── In sprints or iterations, with unit tests
8. Integrate and Test (Incremental)
   ├── Component integration
   ├── Interface testing
   └── Simulation correctness
9. System Verification & Validation
   ├── Against requirements & scenarios
   └── Against stakeholder expectations
10. Final Documentation & Delivery
    └── Code, interfaces, user manuals, test results
```

## Deliverables

1. Scope & Stakeholders

- [ ] Description: Identify goals, end-users, and constraints
- [ ] Deliverables: Project charter, stakeholder map

2. Use Cases & Scenarios

- Description: Define simulation stories or mission threads
- Deliverables: Use case descriptions, sequence diagrams

3. Requirements Definition

- Description: Capture functional needs, performance constraints, and objectives
- Deliverables: SRS (Software Requirements Specification)

4. System Architecture

- Description: High-level decomposition: modules, interfaces, runtime context
- Deliverables: Architecture document, component diagram

5. Component & Data Design

- Description: Specify functional behavior and data flow; design data model
- Deliverables: Design specs, UML (activity/class/ER diagrams)

6. Integration Architecture

- Description: Define simulation framework, timing model (e.g., time-stepped, HLA, DIS)
- Deliverables: Interface control doc, time & event coordination

7. Development

- Description: Code the simulation components per function
- Deliverables: Source code, unit test cases

8. Integration & Testing

- Description: Combine modules; test against use cases and interfaces
- Deliverables: Test reports, simulation logs

9. V&V

- Description: Validate against requirements and real-world expectations
- Deliverables: Validation report, traceability matrix

10. Documentation & Delivery

- Description: Final packaging of code, manuals, test evidence
- Deliverables: User manual, API reference, release package
