## Clarification of terms

**Actor**<br>
An organization *in the game*, such as a supplier, distributor, market.

**BTO**<br>
Buy to Order. Goods are only purchased once an external customer order is received. Synonym for PTO. (sometimes called *Non-stocked Item*).

**Game version**<br>
Full specification of the game that contains parameters that determine the game play and game experience for the players (events, included actors, map, scenarios, etc.).

**HLA**<br>
High-Level Architecture, an IEEE standard for distributed simulation (IEEE-1516).

**MRP**<br>
Manufacturing Resource Planning. A bookkeeping method to keep track of the inventory by distinguishing the actual amount in the warehouse, the amount that has already been reserved for customers, and the amount that has already been ordered to replenish the stock. The bookkeeping avoids double ordering for replenishment, and promising inventory to a customer when it is actually not available (anymore).

**MTO**<br>
Make to Order. The manufacturer only produces when there is an order. No forecasts or service-level targets are used. Zero stock.

**MTS**<br>
Make to Stock. The manufacturer produces in anticipation of demand, based on forecasts or service-level targets.

**Organization**
A collection of users of the GSCG platform, such as a university. Note that the term organization typically does NOT point to an organization in the game. The term 'actor' is reserved for in-game organizations.

**Player**<br>
A player controls the actions of an Actor in the game. It can be a *User* but this is not necessary, since players can also play the game in an anonymous way.

**PTO**<br>
Procure to Order. Goods are only purchased once an external customer order is received. Synonym for BTO. (sometimes called *Non-stocked Item*).

**RTI**<br>
The so-called Run-Time Infrastructure that takes care of the centralized tasks for the High-Level Architcture (HLA), such as federate management, time management and data management.

**SKU**<br>
Stock Keeping Unit. The unit in which products are typically sold by supply chain actors. This can, for instance be Europallet, an aircraft pallet, a container, a box, or a unit. Actors cannot order goods any smaller than the SKU.

**STF**<br>
Stock to Forecast (sometimes called *Stocked Item*). Goods are procured in advance and kept on hand, based on demand forecast or service-level target.

**User**<br>
A registered user of the platform. Facilitators and Administrators are examples of users. Players *can* be users, but if play has to be anonymous (no real names, no email address), a player can also exist without a corresponding user.
