5.1 Function and Service Design

The inner working of the simulation model is based on a simplified diagram of messages between actors in the supply chain simulation. The model has its roots in SCOR, and in the research by Van Houten (2007) and Van Krevelen (2011). 

The sequence diagram of messages between roles in the simulation model is as follows:
